User: Create a hello world script

Thought: I need to create a new file with a simple script
Action: file_write({"path": "hello.sh", "content": "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Hello, World!'"})

Observation: Successfully wrote 35 bytes to hello.sh

Thought: The script is created. I should verify it exists.
Action: list_directory({"path": "."})

Observation: ... hello.sh ...

Thought: The file exists. Task is complete.
Final Answer: I've created hello.sh with a simple bash script that prints "Hello, World!". You can run it with `bash hello.sh`.
